# Customer-Churn-Analysis-End-to-End-Analytics-ML-Project

## Overview
This project delivers a complete, production-style customer churn analytics and prediction solution using **SQL Server, Power BI, and Python-based machine learning**. The objective is to move beyond descriptive reporting and enable data-driven customer retention decisions by identifying churn drivers, high-risk segments, and predicting future churners.\
The solution mirrors real-world enterprise analytics workflows, covering ETL design, data validation, KPI standardization, interactive BI dashboards, and predictive modeling.

## Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue, growth, and long-term profitability—especially in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. Organizations often struggle with:
* Fragmented churn metrics across reports
* Limited visibility into churn drivers
* Reactive retention strategies instead of proactive interventions
  
This project addresses those gaps by building a ****repeatable churn monitoring and prediction pipeline****.

## Target Audience
While the dataset is telecom-focused, the methodology is industry-agnostic and applicable to:
* Telecom & utilities
* Subscription-based services
* Retail & e-commerce
* Financial services
* SaaS platforms
  
Any organization with recurring customers and transactional data can adapt this approach.

## Project Objectives
* Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline for customer churn analysis
* Standardize churn KPIs and definitions across reporting layers
* Analyze churn drivers across demographic, geographic, service, and account dimensions
* Predict future churners using machine learning
* Enable proactive, operationally actionable retention insights

## Dataset
* ~6,400 customer records<br/>
* 32 structured attributes
  * Covers demographics, services, contracts, billing, tenure, revenue, and churn reasons
