# Customer-Churn-Analysis-End-to-End-Analytics-ML-Project
## Overview
This project delivers a complete, production-style customer churn analytics and prediction solution using **SQL Server, Power BI, and Python-based machine learning**. The objective is to move beyond descriptive reporting and enable data-driven customer retention decisions by identifying churn drivers, high-risk segments, and predicting future churners.\
The solution mirrors real-world enterprise analytics workflows, covering ETL design, data validation, KPI standardization, interactive BI dashboards, and predictive modeling.

## Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue, growth, and long-term profitability—especially in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. Organizations often struggle with:\
* Fragmented churn metrics across reports\
* Limited visibility into churn drivers\
* Reactive retention strategies instead of proactive interventions\
  
This project addresses those gaps by building a ****repeatable churn monitoring and prediction pipeline****.


End-to-end customer churn analytics and prediction solution using SQL Server, Power BI, and Random Forest modelling—built to replicate enterprise-grade ETL, KPI standardisation, and retention decision workflows.
